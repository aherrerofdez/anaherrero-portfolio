                Hey there! I'm a passionate builder, from designing interfaces and writing code to DIY-ing around the house. I 
                grew up in <a href="https://g.co/kgs/sBPL3Z">Segovia</a>, a historic city in Spain. Therefore, I am a native 
                speaker of Spanish and I've been using English as my second language in a professional environment for +7 years. 
                I have professional working proficiency in French, and elementary proficiency in Modern Standard Arabic. 
                Currently, studying Finnish and Italian, while reviewing my French and Arabic weekly.

                I studied Information Systems Management at <a href="https://www.ie.edu/university/">IE University</a> in Madrid, 
                combining my interests in Business Administration and Computer Science. I also spent a semester studying abroad 
                at the <a href="https://www.aub.edu.lb/">American University of Beirut</a> in Lebanon, where I explored the 
                fields of Psychology and Education while eating za'atar manakeesh. The knowledge acquired in these fields in 
                addition to my expertise in mobile app development, inspired my Bachelor's thesis on using technology to help 
                children with Down Syndrome acquire basic mathematical skills.

                During my thesis, I realized the importance of interface design to obtain a great user experience, which led me 
                to pursue a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction and Design, specializing in Accessibility and 
                Adaptability. I completed a dual degree program from the <a href="https://www.upm.es/">Technical University of 
                Madrid (UPM)</a> and <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en">Aalto University</a> in Helsinki, Finland. Additionally, 
                I minored in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, as I have always been interested in the fast-paced world of 
                entrepreneurship. My Master's thesis focused on developing a program that simplifies information according to 
                the easy-to-read guidelines for individuals with cognitive disabilities.

                role in organizing mentoring sessions, matchmaking sprints, and establishing partnerships with VCs, facilitating 
                connections for early-stage startups and contributing to significant product growth.

                research group</a> in the Technical University of Madrid, Spain, where I contributed to the transition of an

                the product strategy, built an API to transform texts according to <a

                Outside my work life, I enjoy more creative hobbies, particularly, cooking, photography and reading, ranging
