                Hey there! I'm a passionate builder, from designing interfaces and writing code to DIY-ing around the house. I grew 
                up in Segovia, a historic city in Spain. Therefore, I am a native speaker of Spanish and I've been using English as 
                my second language in a professional environment for +7 years. I have professional working proficiency in French, 
                and elementary proficiency in Modern Standard Arabic. Currently, studying Finnish and Italian, while reviewing my 
                French and Arabic weekly.

                I studied Information Systems Management at IE University in Madrid, combining my interests in Business 
                Administration and Computer Science. I also spent a semester studying abroad at the American University of Beirut 
                in Lebanon, where I explored the fields of Psychology and Education while eating za'atar manakeesh. The knowledge 
                acquired in these fields in addition to my expertise in mobile app development, inspired my Bachelor's thesis on 
                using technology to help children with Down Syndrome acquire basic mathematical skills.

                During my thesis, I realized the importance of interface design to obtain a great user experience, which led me to 
                pursue a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction and Design, specializing in Accessibility and Adaptability. 
                I completed a dual degree program from the Technical University of Madrid (UPM) and Aalto University in Helsinki, 
                Finland. Additionally, I minored in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, as I have always been interested in the 
                fast-paced world of entrepreneurship. My Master's thesis focused on developing a program that simplifies information 
                according to the easy-to-read guidelines for individuals with cognitive disabilities.

                In my current role as Product Operations Manager at Slush in Helsinki, Finland, I have been improving the digital 
                platform for startups, Node by Slush, by gathering user feedback, analyzing data, benchmarking against competitors, 
                and driving the development of new features. I've also played a vital role in organizing mentoring sessions, 
                matchmaking sprints, and establishing partnerships with VCs, facilitating connections for early-stage startups and 
                contributing to significant product growth.

                Before joining Slush, I was a Full-stack Developer at a research group in the Technical University of Madrid, Spain, 
                where I contributed to the transition of an idea into a viable product in just six months. I collaborated effectively 
                with cross-functional teams, managed the product strategy, built an API to transform texts according to the 
                Easy-To-Read Methodology, and tested the product with end-users and other stakeholders.

                Outside my work life, I enjoy more creative hobbies, particularly, cooking, photography and reading, ranging from 
                mystery novels to research papers on developmental psychology. However, nothing beats a lengthy bike ride, 
                occasionally interrupted to complete a few sudokus. You can find some pictures below showcasing my culinary 
                creations and my photography skills, as well as my most valuable asset in Helsinki, my bike — Yes, my friends often
