            <h2>GET TO KNOW ME</h2>
            <p>
                Passionate about leveraging technology to create impactful products, I'm an 
                experienced Product Manager skilled at driving product development from 
                conception to launch. With a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction 
                and Design from Aalto University and Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, 
                alongside diverse experiences in full-stack development, entrepreneurship, 
                and data science, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and strategic 
                vision to every project. My proficiency spans software development, user 
                experience design, market analysis, and product innovation. I thrive in 
                collaborative environments where I can apply my analytical mindset and 
                problem-solving abilities to drive business growth and deliver exceptional 
                user experiences.<br>
                <br>
                Currently based in Madrid, I've spent over 5 years living abroad in vibrant 
                cities like Beirut and Helsinki, which has cultivated a deep appreciation for 
                diverse cultures. Fluent in English and Spanish, I'm eager to practice my 
                French and currently delving into Arabic. When I'm not geeking out over tech 
                stuff, you'll find me exploring my other passions: music and psychology. 
                Additionally, I'm an avid outdoor enthusiast, enjoying activities like biking, 
                swimming, and hiking. Let's connect and explore collaboration possibilities!<br>
