            <!-- TO-DO: Link "creative ideas" to the Projects page -->
            <p>
                With a strong background in product management, development, and design across various industries, I bring valuable 
                skills to the Product team. I'm a dynamic and results-driven lifelong learner with a global mindset. I'm committed to 
                improving user experiences, with a special focus on Accessibility and Adaptability. I enjoy creating innovative 
                products that help individuals, particularly in the education and healthcare industries. My diverse skill set spans 
                UX/UI design, web app development, API creation, NLP, and digital marketing, enabling me to bring creative ideas to 
                life and drive growth. <br>
                <br>
                Beyond work, I'm passionate about math, music, developmental psychology, and language learning. I'm fluent in 
                English and Spanish and have professional working proficiency in French. In my free time, I like biking, swimming, 
                tennis, hiking, photography, and mystery novels. <br>
